# KidzoApp
My project's core concept was centered on assisting mothers and caregivers in looking after children aged 1-8. In response to this challenge, I developed a mobile application that comprehensively addresses child safety and well-being, comprising six key components, all aligned with the overarching goal of safeguarding children:
1. Child Safety Detection: In the initial section, users gain the capability to activate their device's camera, which employs an AI model to perform real-time child safety checks. Following the development and meticulous training of the AI model, I seamlessly integrated it with the backend using Java Spring Boot. The app communicates with the server to access the model's results.

2. Mapping to Nearby Facilities: In the second section, users can easily locate the closest hospitals or pharmacies based on their current location, ensuring rapid access to essential medical services.
3. Childcare Information: This section provides users with scientifically sound guidance on interacting with children, promoting proper care, and nurturing.
4. Doctor Consultation: The 'Doctor' section facilitates direct, real-time chats with experts, allowing users to seek professional advice on childcare matters.
5. Medical History: Users can conveniently record specific appointments and vital medical information, including check-up schedules, medication regimens, and other essential health-related details.
6. Community: The 'Community' section serves as an engaging platform for users to connect, share insights, and support one another. Admins maintain oversight, ensuring the quality and appropriateness of posted content.
